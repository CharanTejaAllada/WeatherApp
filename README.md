# WeatherApp
Right now I have created a bare bone architecture of Server Clients on C++ with two threads doing the work.

Problem Statement:

Create a Cleint/Server program using ZMQ which is a multi threaded application. Server will download the weather data from https://openweathermap.org/api.
Many number ofclients can be connected to Server and the server responds to the different requests generated by different clients.
Client generated requests are queries which request for cities, temperature with cities and many more.
You any database of files to save the data.
